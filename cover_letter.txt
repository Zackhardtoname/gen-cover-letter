Dear #company,

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself as a viable candidate for your #internship for #period. As a sophomore majoring in Math, CS, and Business at Boston University, I have been drawn to #field for its nature of creating business impact through technologies.

I have received numerous awards including 1st place at a machine learning hackathon hosted by Google at MIT in early 2019. In the summer of 2018, I worked for China Minsheng Banking Corp. (the 36th largest bank in the world by total assets) in Beijing on news extraction, chatbots, as well as task automation through TensorFlow/Keras and Neo4j. Through the course Data Science in R, I also completed a project regressing and visualizing Tesla' stock price and sentiments of the tweet regarding Tesla. I also pocess other skills. To illustrate, my past projects (available at zackLight.com) also help me excel in web development.

I appreciate your time. Please consider allowing me to contribute my technical skills and strong initiative to #company. I can be reached at 617-312-1318 and zackL@bu.edu.

Sincerely,
Yi (Zack) Zhang
