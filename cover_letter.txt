Yi (Zack) ZhangPhone: 617-312-1318Email: zackLT@umich.eduDear #company,I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself as a viable candidate for your #internship for #period. As a rising junior studying CS and Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, I have been drawn to #field after seeing how it creates powerful narratives of products and makes evidence-informed decisions for businesses.Conducting data mining research at school, I have also received numerous data science awards from organizations like Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba. In the summer of 2019, I interned as a software engineer in Boston and worked on great machine learning and mobile/web app projects. In the summer of 2018, I worked for China Minsheng Banking Corp. (the 36th largest bank globally by total assets) in Beijing on news extraction, chatbots, as well as task automation through TensorFlow/Keras and Neo4j.Curious, inventive, and collaborative would be the adjectives I describe myself in. Please allow me to contribute my skills (such as #skills) to #company. I can be reached at 617-312-1318 and zackLT@umich.edu.Sincerely,Yi (Zack) Zhang
