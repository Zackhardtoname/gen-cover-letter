Zack ZhangPhone: 617-312-1318Email: zackLT@umich.eduDear #company,I am Zack and will be graduating in May 2021 with a CS and Data Science double major from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.My diverse experiences in software development, design, and data science make me an excellent fit for #internship. Last summer, as an intern at Nokia Bell Labs, I built a data conversion library in C for a networking data pipeline serving 6.1 billion subscribers. In 2019, I enjoyed using technologies like Java, Spring Boot, and React to develop machine learning and mobile/full-stack web apps. I was solely responsible for many of the new projects starting from designing, rapid prototyping, and A/B testing. In 2018, I worked for China Minsheng Banking Corp. (the 36th largest bank globally by total assets) in Beijing on news extraction, chatbots, as well as task automation through TensorFlow/Keras and Neo4j. I have also received numerous data science awards from organizations like Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba. You could check out my portfolio at https://zacklight.com/#portfolio.My work at Nokia illustrates my ability to learn fast and deliver well. Initially, relatively new to Kafka, I went ahead to read a whole book on Kafka in my free time and quickly picked up all the important concepts. Although the data pipeline at Nokia is a fairly complex real-time system handling extremely large data streams, I had an easy time implementing and debugging the program through a good understanding Kafka internals. Eventually, I made the original program more dynamic, scalable, and reliable with duplicate Kafka partitions.I sincerely appreciate your help and look forward to hearing back from you!Sincerely,Zack Zhang
